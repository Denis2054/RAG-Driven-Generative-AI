In 1969, the Apollo 11 mission marked the first time humans set foot upon another world. Crewed exploration of the Moon did not continue for long.

The research that is conducted by national space exploration agencies, such as NASA and Roscosmos , is one of the reasons supporters cite to justify government expenses. Economic analyses of the NASA programs often showed ongoing economic benefits (such as NASA spin-offs ), generating many times the revenue of the cost of the program.  It is also argued that space exploration would lead to the extraction of resources on other planets and especially asteroids, which contain billions of dollars worth of minerals and metals. Such expeditions could generate a lot of revenue.  In addition, it has been argued that space exploration programs help inspire youth to study in science and engineering.  Space exploration also gives scientists the ability to perform experiments in other settings and expand humanity's knowledge.
